== Having fun with jbake ==

Writing a blog with jbake is so much more fun in contrast to using ghost or any other cms.
But I thing thats because I'm kind of a Commandline junkie.
And editing a Post with vim. Pushing it with git. Bake and publish it with gradle is really fun to do.
Feels like coding. But isn't.
